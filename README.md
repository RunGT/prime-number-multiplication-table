# Prime Number Multiplication Table

## Task

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers. 


## How to run

Clone the repo ` git clone https://github.com/RunGT/prime-number-multiplication-table.git `

Install dev dependancies ` npm i `

To run tests ` npm run test `

To print the table in the terminal ` node main.js `

To change n for the prime multiplication table, navigate to main.js  line 32 and input a number into ` useInputNumberToCreatePrimeMultiplicationTable(); ` Currently 3 is the input

## Tech stack

- Javascript
- Jest


### Still to do / If I had more time:

- Create a html page and render the table to the page using DOM. [MDN Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Traversing_an_HTML_table_with_JavaScript_and_DOM_Interfaces)

- Refactor for efficiency 

- Use Cypress for end to end testing, once the front end has been built. 

- More tests

I will be adding these features on a new branch.
